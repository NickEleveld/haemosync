# haemosync
haemosync is a synchronisation algorithm for multimodal haemodynamic signals

Two versions of the code are available: 
- m-file format (Matlab)
- mlx-file format (Matlab Live Script)

Explanations and comments are provided in the code files
In main_script.m / main_script.mlx, the input signals can be selected and settings can be optimised (default values are available). All other files are Matlab functions that are (indirectly/directly) called by main_script.m / main_script.mlx
